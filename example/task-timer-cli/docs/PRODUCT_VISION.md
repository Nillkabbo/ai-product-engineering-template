# Product Vision

## Overview
A lightweight CLI tool for developers to track time spent on coding tasks.

## Problem
Developers need a simple, terminal-based way to track time without context-switching to GUI apps or web services.

## Target Users
- Individual developers
- Remote workers who bill by the hour
- Anyone who lives in the terminal

## Goals
- Start/stop timers with one command
- View time logs easily
- Export to CSV for invoicing

## Non-Goals
- Team collaboration features
- Web interface
- Advanced reporting/analytics
- Integration with project management tools

## Success Metrics
- Can track a work session end-to-end
- Export works for invoicing
- Under 500 lines of code
