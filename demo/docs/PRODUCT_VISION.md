# Product Vision

## Overview
A simple, efficient To-Do List application focused on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) functionality. It allows users to manage their daily tasks with zero friction.

## Problem
People often forget small daily tasks or feel overwhelmed by complex project management tools. They need a lightweight, immediate way to capture and track their to-dos.

## Target Users
- Individuals looking for a simple personal task manager.
- Users who value speed and simplicity over complex features.

## Goals
- **Core Functionality**: Users can Add, List, Complete, and Delete tasks.
- **Time Tracking**: Users can track time spent on each task (Start/Stop).
- **Simplicity**: Minimalist UI with no learning curve.
- **Performance**: Instant interactions (loading, adding, updating).

## Non-Goals
- User Authentication (for MVP, local storage or simple session is sufficient unless otherwise decided in Architecture).
- Complex features like sub-tasks, recurring tasks, or sharing.
- Mobile implementation (web-first).

## Success Metrics
- A user can add a task and mark it as complete within 5 seconds.
- Zero critical bugs in the core "CRUD" flow.
